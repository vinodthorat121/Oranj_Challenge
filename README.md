# OranjJavaInternChallenge
Hack some Java and join Oranj as a engineering Intern!

INSTRUCTIONS:
You are to implement some missing backend functionality for a Pokemon Battle application.

You will see several failing unit tests. These should serve as guidelines for where the missing functionality is. Note that unit tests are on the method level, and are named after methods. You are to fill in the missing code for the indicated methods.

TIPS:
* Don't worry about perfection. 
* Don't get stressed out if the unit tests are not passing--even if none end up passing. 
* If you extend the provided code in a way that makes sense, then you have done the challenge successfully
* We are looking to see HOW YOU THINK and HOW YOU CODE--be ready to talk about your code
* REMEMBER: when in doubt, write SOMETHING!
* Run your unit tests as you go
